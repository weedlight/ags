    When I started to use GNU/Linux in 2001 I missed only one thing. A sequencer with a
    nice GUI. There was already rosegarden available. But who didn't get stuck of midi
    setup, yet? The time before I was using free software and became an affiliate to its
    community I was using &win98; on my father's desktop computer and did my first steps
    in &java2;.

    My very first own Notebook was a &n160; and it's preinstalled &win98; had to vanish
    because I became a fellow of &stallman;. Soon, I begun to code and older I became my
    demands to ags increased. I developed the concept of the underlying audio library
    myself as not graduated college student.

    October 2005, I decided to reimplement &ags; from scratch in order to get rid of
    inherited burden. And it was one big development process until I was almost satisfied
    with it's design. There was a time in 2007 where I even wanted to replace GObject and
    Gtk+ dependencies with my own libraries I begun to develop. I'm glad of didn't doing
    so.
