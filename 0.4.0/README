You need a realtime kernel in conjunction with ags. The realtime kernel shipped with Ubuntu Studio didn't work but a self compiled worked. See http://rt.wiki.kernel.org/ for more information. 


TODO:
- fix ids in AgsRecallID, use pointers instead of a counter
- fix AgsAudio shouldn't contain an AgsDevout move it to AgsChannel
- fix ags_channel_recursive_play_init to use AgsRecallContainer
- call run_order_changed in AgsRecall from ags_channel_recursive_play_init
- revise ags_recall_set_property
- revise destroy functions - disconnect before destroying
- play channel when linked if needed
- implement an iteration function for ags_channel_recursive_play_init
- AgsCopyPattern implementation in AgsDrum and AgsMatrix doesn't have correct abort code, perhaps see AgsDelay
- remove recalls after the 3 stages were executed in ags_channel_recursive_play
- take care of owner (AgsRecallID) in AgsAudioSignal
- don't make AgsDelay use AgsDevouts counter
- destroy AgsRecalls and AgsAudioSignals
- implement cancel signal in AgsRecalls
- update retrieving of AgsDelay in recalls, recalls should duplicate AgsDelays in contrast plays work fine
- modify ags_audio_set_audio_channels and ags_audio_set_pads so that it updates parent AgsChannel's first_recycling and last_recycling
- ags_channel_set_link must be modified that it works with playing AgsChannels and check for an existing AgsRecallContainer
- ags_machine_link_editor_callbacks.c replace code in callbacks with ags_machine_link_editor_reset_input and ags_machine_link_editor_reset_output
- ags_matrix.c shrink the GtkDrawingArea in ags_matrix_set_pads if there are less than eight input pads
- update notation after resizing audio channels
- remove ags_editor_reset and move code to callback functions
- ags_editor.c implement machine_changed signal
- ags_audio.c add protection against multiple pads on AgsChannel's with AGS_AUDIO_ASYNC and without AgsAudioSignal on AgsOutput

DONE:
- write a destroy task (see <ags/audio/recall/ags_remove_audio_run.[ch]>)

BUGS:
- ags_recall_volume causes the AgsAudioSignal to quiet down: check wheter it has been fixed through uninitialized AgsDevout->audio bug fix
- ags_audio_set_audio_channels do proper set_async_link: believed to be fixed
- ags_editor_index_callback crashes: believed to be fixed
- application crashes while running an AgsSynth linked with an AgsMatrix, when AgsOscillator has different length

WARNING:
- ags_copy_pattern should be used only once by an AgsAudio because in ags_copy_pattern_duplicate detection of AgsCopyPatternAudioRun can't handle more than one

DEPRECATED:
- ags_play_pattern.c
- ags_garbage_collector.c

NOTES:
- AgsRecallID gives every stream an identification and makes it possible to stop a single of multiple AgsRecalls that are possible. Imagine an AgsAudio object is played and a child of it, too. A child of the child is also played and so on.


RELEASE NOTES:

ags_0.3.9.6:
	- AgsStreamLock removed
	- ags_garbage_collector removed
